This approach is consistent both with a <p> game theory </p> approach and with the logical framework.
Mathematical <p> game theory </p> recognises that games exist in which the gain of one party does not result in the loss of the other.
"Thus, the German system was built around systematic discrimination, whereas the <p> GATT </p> assured nondiscrimination for all contracting parties."

One could be inclined to adopt the view that institutionalisation of <p> horizontal integration </p> is not necessary.
"In industries with high fixed costs, <p> horizontal integration </p> enables firms to benefit from greater economies of scale."
A community with a high degree of <p> horizontal integration </p> is characterized by a tightly knit social network with relatively equal power distributions.
"Ensuring that newly obtained businesses fit in with the companyâs model, marketing plays a big part in the way big corporations act, which is where <p> horizontal integration </p> comes into play."
"Therefore, the system does not provide the benefits of <p> horizontal integration </p>, which users are demanding."
"Vertical and <p> horizontal integration </p> is a necessity, and the joint bodies are the framework where such integration takes place."
"They all point to a need for action on a number of fronts: <p> horizontal integration </p>, partnerships, culture, service in the public interest, policy capacity, client-focused service and human resource management."
"As per Recommendation 8, due consideration should be given to exploring opportunities for better <p> horizontal integration </p> with other biotechnology programs."

Why work when we can all borrow against an ever upward spiral of <p> house prices </p>?
Fitzpatrick denied that higher <p> house prices </p> were in builders ' interests and said his members wanted to promote price stability.
Experience so far suggests that <p> house prices </p> are more likely to stagnate than crash.
Imagine now that <p> house prices </p> carried on falling for the next six months and that consumers took fright.
A York estate agent today hit back at reports that <p> house prices </p> are set to slump in villages around York.

"But in some areas, <p> house prices </p> have reached such a level that properties have become unaffordable, despite the low cost of borrowing."
Here are five companies that could falter should <p> house prices </p> take a tumble.
The binary variable is a proxy to account for differences in cost due to location of the firm and <p> human capital </p> intensity.
It appears that <p> human capital </p> and expected wage differences overwhelm the impact of all other variables in the model.
"Thus, corporate university training provides employees with a chance to increase their <p> human capital </p> assets."
"First, <p> human capital </p>, or the skills of the population, increased dramatically."
Investment in education is seen as the key to improving <p> human capital </p> and building the capacity for future economic development.
Fisher clearly understood how investment in <p> human capital </p> operated and the tax consequences for his proposal.
An economy well endowed with <p> human capital </p> is likely to experience a high growth rate.
"The west has huge economic and social potential, along with excellent <p> human capital </p> and entrepreneurial resources."
Employers' decisions to hire and retain will be influenced by information asymmetries regarding an individual's <p> human capital </p>.

"Tajikistan is the poorest of all formerly Soviet republics, according to the UNDP <p> human development index </p>."
"That year, UNDP's <p> human development index </p> ranked Mali lower than Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen."

"If the central </p> bank chooses to persevere in their inflation, hyperinflation will be unleashed<p> ."
"After six year </p>s of war, the country suffered from hyperinflation, food shortages, ill-clothed soldiers, and a plundered citizenry<p> ."
"So far so good </p>, but what about contingency plans to combat inflation, and hyperinflation to boot<p> ?"
This is the po </p>int where the game slips out of the hands of the stabilizers and hyperinflation and depression loom<p> .
"Other reasons  </p>for sudden death include cardiac dysrhythmias related to hypoxia, hyperinflation leading to air trapping, and tension pneumothorax<p> ."
Gold also may  </p>be helpful during periods of hyperinflation as it can hold its purchasing power much better than paper money during these periods<p> .
"This edema lea </p>ds to hyperinflation and atelectasis of the lungs, and wheezing<p> ."
"The traditiona </p>l remedy for inflation in general, and hyperinflation in particular, is gold<p> ."

"If <p> hypothecation </p> is extended and the Treasury manages a series of accounts tying revenue to specific spending, they will lose some of this clout."
Central agencies opposed <p> hypothecation </p> in the absence of financial market disciplines.
Andrew Dilnot of the Institute for Fiscal Studies says <p> hypothecation </p> is just another way to raise taxes.
"Hostility to such <p> hypothecation </p> remains an article of faith in the Treasury, despite recent breaches such as the landfill tax."
The extension of <p> hypothecation </p> to road pricing is thus being described as part of a seamless process.
This could take the form of rules on the <p> hypothecation </p> or ring-fencing of money collected for transport security so as to ensure that it is spent solely and wholly on security.
"Either way, effectively the government is simply using the hypothecated tax as part of general revenue, and the <p> hypothecation </p> is a sham."
"While complete <p> hypothecation </p> is unlikely to be desirable, even in the Public Choice framework, some amount of ear-marking may be required to gain public confidence in the way economic instruments operate."
"There remains a case for identifying new sources of financial support, whether from <p> hypothecation </p> of charges for road use or from value capture from those whose property values rise as a result of transport investment."
"<p> Hypothecation </p> came to an end in 1937 under the 1936 Finance Act, and the proceeds of the vehicle road taxes were paid directly into the Exchequer."
The silicon steels are designed to have lower <p> hysteresis </p> and eddy current losses than plain steel when used in magnetic circuits.
"A noncontact, no-wear design eliminates <p> hysteresis </p> and friction for reliability and repeatability."
"Some commercial microscopes are enhanced with distance sensors such as strain gauge or capacitive sensors, which remove most of the <p> hysteresis </p>."
A large degree of <p> hysteresis </p> upon indenter retraction was observed.
"With the parameters we use, this <p> hysteresis </p> covers a rather small range of velocities and only results in a small inflexion in the force-velocity curve."
Regulation: It returns the working pressure to 230 bar and levels out the hydraulic operating <p> hysteresis </p>.
The <p> hysteresis </p> is to prevent the alerts from sounding constantly due to small fluctuations near the alert value.
"So the next line of defence against <p> hysteresis </p> is to keep the jobless in the labour force, actively looking for work."
A <p> hysteresis </p> around the individual cutin and cutout points will ensure that the relay will not cut in or out when it is not called for.
"Although there are inherent benefits to both, the spool design provides lower <p> hysteresis </p> while the poppet design provides very low leakage."
The <p> ILO </p> attributes the jobs crisis to the social effects of contractionary economic policies.
"The <p> ILO </p> should perhaps systemise disclosure of best practices, a kind of 'peer review', in a bid to continually persuade."
The <p> ILO </p> has been doing yeoman service and has been a pioneer in shaping the labour-employer relationship.
"Both these elements ensure that the <p> ILO </p> is not merely a paper tiger, but actively plays a key role in the general debate."
It is also worth noting that the Government has built a partnership with the <p> ILO </p> and that consultation mechanisms have been expanded nationwide.
Trocaire hope many more thousands will be completed by the end of May when they will be bundled together and brought to a key <p> ILO </p> conference in Geneva in June.
The Executive Council of <p> ILO </p> has decided to focus the general debate of the International Labour Conference on the topic of migrant workers.
I think that people will be able to work together with the <p> ILO </p> for a strong social and solidarity economy.

"For the first time in any <p> ILO </p> Convention, the MLC includes seafarers' rights to shore leave."
We are using <p> IMF </p> as shorthand for the entire grouping of moral hazard intensifiers we listed at the outset!
The <p> IMF </p> said last week that the government may need to resort to spending cuts if it runs out of funding sources.
The <p> IMF </p> is worried China's economy could overheat and generate a troubling inflation that would raise the risk of an economic crash.
"The <p> IMF </p> and the World Bank find him a ridiculous figure, jetting around the world while his people starve."
The <p> IMF </p> programs of stabilization based on fiscal austerity have also been too contractionary.
"Following the crisis, Russia's administration requested <p> IMF </p> funds primarily for debt relief."
"Turkey, which like Argentina has received a large <p> IMF </p> bail-out, warned it may not be able to meet next year's repayments."
"Even worse, these utilities are often a continual drain and national budgets, thus the need to go to the <p> IMF </p> or World Bank for bailouts."
The <p> IMF </p> insists that the Department of Statistics gets economic data together in a timely fashion.
Officials said negotiators had been close to agreement when the <p> IMF </p> made new demands for savage budget cuts.
Monopolistic competition refers to a particular way of modelling <p> imperfect competition </p> among sellers in a market.
Yet even the introduction of an <p> imperfect competition </p> has already boosted quality and lowered prices.
The two others have a homogenous labour supply with <p> imperfect competition </p> either in the goods or the labour market.
"Consistent with other studies on exchange rate pass-through under <p> imperfect competition </p>, the authors' analysis shows that exchange rate pass-through into domestic and foreign prices is incomplete."
"Again, in the academic studies, one of the things that's likely to influence interchange fees is whether or not there's more <p> imperfect competition </p> at the issuing end or more imperfect competition at the acquiring end."
"The reasons for the late and sluggish rebound are to be sought in structural rigidities. Important in this regard are rigidities weighing on investment, wage stickiness and <p> imperfect competition </p>, particularly in services."
"Only companies have the type of information required to undertake a proper analysis of <p> imperfect competition </p>, but this information is commercially confidential and few researchers have access to it."
"The state is therefore called upon, particularly in conditions of <p> imperfect competition </p>, to play a subsidiary role of considerable importance as a catalyst for tourism development."
"Under <p> imperfect competition </p>, the costs of higher minimum wages can also be met through some combination of reduced profits, redistribution of labour costs among workers within firms and higher prices passed on to consumers."
"In the real world, markets often experience <p> imperfect competition </p>."
"With very low inventories of gasoline and distillates in the US, any reduction in <p> imports </p> will have an exponential impact on prices."
He rejected their request for limits of Chinese <p> imports </p> of welded steel pipes.
So it is with no bias that he has programmed four home-grown shows alongside the exotic <p> imports </p> in this year's event.

A new structure of tariffs on <p> imports </p> is designed to further protect Russian industries from foreign competition.
The demographic information shows that the population increased but the average <p> income </p> went down.
Only when Basel's reformers turned to iconoclasm in the later 1520s did his freedom and <p> income </p> as a religious artist suffer.
The university also receives a significant <p> income </p> in annual transfers from the Cambridge University Press.
"As a consequence, loan repayments are only made when the former student has <p> income </p> to support the repayments."
"The inception date of the modern <p> income </p> tax is typically accepted as 1799, at the suggestion of Henry Beeke, the future Dean of Bristol."
"Tourism is an important, even vital, source of <p> income </p> for many regions and countries."
The book focused on determinants of national <p> income </p> in the short run when prices are relatively inflexible.
"Nonresidents are taxed only on certain types of <p> income </p> from sources within the jurisdictions, with few exceptions."
"College tuition has risen sharply in the last decade, while family <p> income </p> has fallen."
"The sum of expenditures and taxes minus total <p> income </p> is a loss, when this difference is positive."
Some Austrian economists have tried to refute this argument by denying the very existence of an <p> income effect </p>.
This combination of price effect and <p> income effect </p> has been a powerful stimulus to mobility.
"Labor is not as mobile as financial capital, and the <p> income effect </p> helps offset the substitution effect."
"If this <p> income effect </p> were to become powerful enough, it would be a nice irony."
"In addition, the <p> income effect </p> is also included because the distribution of values-of-time is derived from the distribution of incomes."
This can be partially offset by improved efficiency but the <p> income effect </p> still results in rising demand.
The after-tax <p> income effect </p> resulting from changes in assumptions for insurance contract liabilities is shown in the table below.
"Furthermore, as the <p> income effect </p> of lower interest rates is significant, the implied decline in household disposable income should dampen the stimulus to demand."
The current <p> income effect </p> of oil revenues had been leveraged through the international and domestic asset markets with the development of the financial sectors.
"Beyond 17 weeks, both the <p> income effect </p> of the UI benefits and the substitution effect induced by the lower net wage lead to negative effects on weeks worked."
"In short, the <p> income tax </p> was not initially a tax on wages, nor on the working class."
This confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of <p> income tax </p>.
"The paradigm of direct taxation is <p> income tax </p>, the paradigm of indirect taxation is a tax on sales."
"If you're a higher-rate taxpayer, you get <p> income tax </p> relief on your dividends too."
Proper documentation also ensures both <p> income tax </p> deductibility and goods and services tax input tax credit eligibility.
"For if <p> income tax </p> dissuades the living rich from being rich, then the death tax can only dissuade the dead rich from dying."
"You can claim money spent on doctors, physiotherapists, psychiatrists and qualifying medicines at your marginal rate of <p> income tax </p>."
Gross it up by your marginal rate of <p> income tax </p> and you see the full horrors of the Stealth Tax policy.
